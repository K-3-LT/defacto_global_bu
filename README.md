# Project Purpose
The objective of this project is to develop an AI-based bot utilizing a small Large Language Model (LLM) that can run on a laptop or small server. This bot will be trained using deFacto's existing training materials, with an initial step involving the evaluation and selection of the most suitable LLM based on a predetermined set of criteria.

Further enhancements to the bot's capabilities may be explored if time allows.

# Objectives
1. LLM Selection (Critical): Evaluate and select an LLM based on predefined selection criteria.
2. Training Material Compilation (Critical): Compile deFacto's training materials in a format suitable for LLM training.
3. LLM Training (Critical): Evaluate options for training the LLM and conduct the training using deFacto's materials.
4. Update Pipeline/Process Development (Critical): Develop a system for updating the LLM's knowledge as deFacto's product evolves.
5. User Interface Development (Important but not critical): Develop user interfaces as required.
6. Bot Capability Expansion (Nice to have): Enhance the bot's capabilities to support other functional needs of users, including executing instructions.

# Significance
This project holds significant importance for deFacto Global Inc. as LLMs are expected to have a massive impact on the software industry. We aim to harness the power of LLMs to perform a wide range of functions, including potentially replacing software. This project will allow us to assess the feasibility of using small, domain-specific LLMs tailored exclusively to our product.

# Previous Work / Foreseen Challenges
Our journey in this field has just begun as we've started to form our long-term strategy and approach. We've developed prototype applications and are currently collaborating with a team in Troy to advance our efforts.

# Required or Desired Skills
The exact technical skills required will largely depend on the selected LLM. One of our selection criteria will consider any required technical skills. Additionally, a summer intern who is a skilled developer will be working with the team to support any technical needs.

# Data
All materials required to train the model, i.e., deFacto's training materials, are readily available. The format may need to be adjusted based on the LLM's requirements.

# Time/Resource Constraints
Though there are no specific deadlines, this project is planned for the spring and summer. We are ready to start ASAP.

# Alternative Resources
We are working with several resources capable of providing any level of support required by the team.
